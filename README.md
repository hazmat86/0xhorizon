### What We Believe 
We believe that the homeless population is not the problem but rather they are an integral part of the solution if we the community allow it. By rewarding them for good deeds and work done we give them incentive to change. Most importantly, their private life is there own, it is not our business, in short we don't drug test!

### How It Works
Many of the homeless in the community are in a unique position. They have a ton of time on their hands and are extremely resourceful and creative, after all, surviving in a city with the violent crime rate of Asheville is no easy task. So let's use those abilities. We offer them a position, not force. There are no strings attached. Many of them deal with heavy paranoia so we won't be keeping in depth records, just a name, maybe an ID number instead, and of course the tasks they have completed. There is also a tier system. Allow me to explain.....

#### Tier 1 - Cleaning Up
In addition to a "unhoused population problem" Asheville definitely has a trash problem. So let's use one to solve the other! The cities homeless can fill up a trash bag and will be rewarded for each bag they return. They get say, 100 pts per bag. All of the bags wil go to the cities trash yard. If the person sorted the bags ahead of tome they are worth more, if not someone else can earn points by doing the sorting,

##### Points and their uses
Our clients will earn points and be able to spend the points on a variety of things. Examples include:
- A night in a hotel
- Clothing
- Food
- Tools for Work
- Furthering their education
- Advancement to the next tier
- and many more options....
At the early levels we will off the clients exactly what they need or sometimes even want, but cash money isn't a reward just yet.

### Basic Summary
The program is going to be written in go and will consist of a server that holds holds the clients data, keeps all records, etc... and a client that will most likely be an app that is on their phone, or we may install Termux and have it run as a background that will send all the data to the server without any user interaction.
